Overview
This project implements an object detection system using the **YOLOv12s** model.  
The model is trained and evaluated using a custom annotated dataset to detect multiple object classes with high accuracy and real-time performance.
The complete implementation, including data loading, training, validation, and evaluation, is provided in the Jupyter Notebook **YOLOv12s.ipynb**

Objectives
- To implement YOLOv12s for accurate object detection
- To train the model using a custom dataset
- To evaluate performance using standard metrics such as Precision, Recall, and mAP
- To analyze inference speed and model efficiency

Model Used
- **YOLOv12s**
- Lightweight and efficient variant suitable for real-time detection
- Uses CSP-based backbone and PANet feature aggregation
